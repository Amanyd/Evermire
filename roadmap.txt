# üìÖ Project Roadmap: Private Mood Journal Platform (Next.js + MongoDB + AI)

---

## 1. Project Setup & Tooling
- [ ] Initialize a Next.js project using the App Router and TypeScript.
- [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS (for dark/minimal styling, if desired).
- [ ] Add shadcn/ui (optional, for prebuilt UI components).
- [ ] Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Git for code quality and version control.

---

## 2. Database & Backend
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas for cloud database storage.
- [ ] Use Mongoose (or Prisma) for schema modeling and database access.
- [ ] Create models/schemas for User, Post (image, caption, AI analysis), and ChatHistory.
- [ ] Use Next.js API routes for all backend logic (authentication, post creation, AI analysis, analytics, chat).

---

## 3. Authentication (Login Page)
- [ ] Use NextAuth.js for authentication (email/password, optionally social logins).
- [ ] Store user sessions in MongoDB for persistence.
- [ ] Protect all other pages using Next.js Middleware (redirect to login if not authenticated).
- [ ] On successful login, redirect users to the Posts page.

---

## 4. Posts Page (Image & Caption Upload, Private Feed)
- [ ] Allow users to upload an image and enter a caption for a new post.
- [ ] Integrate Cloudinary or UploadThing for image storage; store image URL and caption in MongoDB.
- [ ] On post creation, trigger an API route that sends the image and caption to the OpenAI API (or similar) for analysis.
- [ ] Receive and store AI-generated mood description and mental health trait scores in MongoDB, linked to the post and user.
- [ ] Fetch and display only the logged-in user's posts, sorted by date.
- [ ] Allow users to edit or delete their posts; update or remove associated AI analysis as needed.

---

## 5. Analytics Page (Mood & Mental Health Insights)
- [ ] On page load, aggregate all of the user's post analytics from MongoDB (e.g., mood, trait scores over time).
- [ ] Only analyze new posts; update analytics by merging new data with previous analytics (no need to re-analyze old posts).
- [ ] Use efficient data fetching (Server Components or API routes) to provide analytics data to the frontend.
- [ ] Provide endpoints for the frontend to fetch analytics data for charting and summaries.

---

## 6. Chat Page (AI Assistant)
- [ ] Allow users to send messages to an AI assistant via a chat interface.
- [ ] On each message, trigger an API route that sends the message, along with the user's analytics and post history, to the OpenAI API for context-aware responses.
- [ ] AI responds with suggestions (activities, music, movies, self-care tips) and general conversation, based on the user's current analytics and mood trends.
- [ ] Store chat history in MongoDB, scoped to the user, for persistent conversations.
- [ ] Use efficient data access (Server Components or API routes) to fetch chat history and context.

---

## 7. Polish & Testing
- [ ] Ensure all backend logic is robust, secure, and handles errors gracefully.
- [ ] Test all API routes and data flows (unit and integration tests with Jest, Playwright, or similar).
- [ ] Test authentication, post creation, AI analysis, analytics aggregation, and chat flows end-to-end.
- [ ] Ensure proper access control: users can only access their own data.

---

## 8. Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel for optimal Next.js performance.
- [ ] Connect to production MongoDB Atlas.
- [ ] Set up environment variables for API keys and DB URI.
- [ ] Add error monitoring (Sentry, Vercel Analytics).

# üìù Notes
- Only four main pages: Login, Posts, Analytics, and Chat.
- All posts and analytics are private to the user.
- AI analyzes only new posts, aggregates with previous data for analytics and chat context.
- Focus is on robust backend logic, data flow, and integration with AI and database.
- Each major feature leverages a unique Next.js capability (App Router, API routes, Server Components, Middleware, Image Optimization, etc.).
